# Tic_Tac_Toe
A Udacity project from the "Intro to Java" course.

In this project, I was required to complete the code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The source code of the game GUI and computer logic was provided by Udacity. While you can start compiling and playing straight away, the code is not complete because the game never detects the winner!

# Rules of the Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a 2 player board game. One player is X and the other player is O. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid with 9 cells. The players take turns marking each cell with either an X or an O. The goal for the X player is to get 3 X’s in one line either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The goal for the O player is to get 3 O’s in one line either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
